# Tournament Delete Feature

## Overview

Added the ability to delete tournaments from the tournament list page. When a tournament is deleted, all associated data (players, rounds, and game links) are automatically removed via database CASCADE constraints.

---

## Implementation

### 1. Database Function (`src/lib/db.ts`)

Added `deleteTournament()` function:

```typescript
export async function deleteTournament(tournamentId: string): Promise<void> {
  const pool = getPool();
  // CASCADE automatically deletes:
  // - tournament_players
  // - tournament_rounds
  // - tournament_games
  await pool.query(
    `DELETE FROM tournaments WHERE id = $1`,
    [tournamentId]
  );
}
```

**Key Feature**: The CASCADE foreign key constraints automatically delete all related data:
- `tournament_players` (player participation records)
- `tournament_rounds` (round information)
- `tournament_games` (game linkages)

**Note**: The chess_analyses (actual game analyses) are NOT deleted, only the tournament linkage. This preserves the game analyses for use in other contexts.

---

### 2. API Endpoint (`src/app/api/tournaments/[id]/route.ts`)

Added DELETE method:

```typescript
export async function DELETE(
  request: NextRequest,
  { params }: { params: Promise<{ id: string }> }
) {
  try {
    const { id } = await params;

    // Check if tournament exists
    const tournament = await getTournamentById(id);
    if (!tournament) {
      return NextResponse.json(
        { error: 'Tournament not found' },
        { status: 404 }
      );
    }

    // Delete tournament
    await deleteTournament(id);

    return NextResponse.json({
      success: true,
      message: 'Tournament deleted successfully',
    });
  } catch (error) {
    return NextResponse.json(
      {
        error: 'Failed to delete tournament',
        details: error instanceof Error ? error.message : 'Unknown error',
      },
      { status: 500 }
    );
  }
}
```

**Features**:
- Checks if tournament exists before deleting (404 if not found)
- Returns success message on completion
- Proper error handling with details

---

### 3. UI Implementation (`src/app/tournaments/page.tsx`)

#### Delete Button

Added a delete button to each tournament card:

```typescript
<button
  onClick={(e) => handleDeleteClick(tournament.id, e)}
  disabled={deletingTournament === tournament.id}
  className="absolute top-4 right-4 p-2 text-red-600..."
  title="Delete tournament"
>
  {deletingTournament === tournament.id ? (
    <div className="animate-spin...">
  ) : (
    <svg className="w-5 h-5">...</svg> // Trash icon
  )}
</button>
```

**Features**:
- Positioned in top-right corner of tournament card
- Red color to indicate destructive action
- Shows spinner while deleting
- Disabled during deletion
- Prevents event propagation (doesn't navigate to tournament)

#### Confirmation Modal

Added modal to confirm deletion:

```typescript
{confirmDelete && (
  <div className="fixed inset-0 bg-black bg-opacity-50...">
    <div className="bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 rounded-lg...">
      <h2>Delete Tournament?</h2>
      <p>Are you sure you want to delete this tournament?</p>
      <p>This will permanently delete all tournament data...</p>
      <button onClick={handleCancelDelete}>Cancel</button>
      <button onClick={handleConfirmDelete}>Delete</button>
    </div>
  </div>
)}
```

**Features**:
- Modal overlay with dark background
- Clear warning message
- Explains consequences (data loss, permanent)
- Two buttons: Cancel (gray) and Delete (red)
- Clicking outside doesn't dismiss (forces explicit choice)

#### Delete Logic

```typescript
const handleDeleteClick = (tournamentId: string, e: React.MouseEvent) => {
  e.preventDefault();
  e.stopPropagation();
  setConfirmDelete(tournamentId);
};

const handleConfirmDelete = async () => {
  if (!confirmDelete) return;

  setDeletingTournament(confirmDelete);
  setError(null);

  try {
    const response = await fetch(`/api/tournaments/${confirmDelete}`, {
      method: 'DELETE',
    });

    if (!response.ok) {
      const data = await response.json();
      throw new Error(data.error || 'Failed to delete tournament');
    }

    // Remove tournament from list (optimistic UI update)
    setTournaments(tournaments.filter(t => t.id !== confirmDelete));
    setConfirmDelete(null);
  } catch (err) {
    setError(err instanceof Error ? err.message : 'Failed to delete tournament');
  } finally {
    setDeletingTournament(null);
  }
};

const handleCancelDelete = () => {
  setConfirmDelete(null);
};
```

**Features**:
- Shows confirmation modal on button click
- Prevents navigation when clicking delete button
- Shows loading spinner during deletion
- Optimistic UI update (removes from list immediately)
- Error handling with user-friendly messages
- Resets state after completion

---

## User Flow

### Deleting a Tournament

1. **Navigate to tournaments list**
   - Go to `/tournaments`
   - See all tournaments with delete buttons

2. **Click delete button**
   - Red trash icon in top-right corner
   - Confirmation modal appears
   - Modal has dark overlay

3. **Read warning**
   - "Delete Tournament?" heading in red
   - Warning about permanent deletion
   - Lists what will be deleted

4. **Choose action**
   - **Cancel**: Modal closes, nothing deleted
   - **Delete**: Tournament deletion begins

5. **Deletion in progress**
   - Delete button shows spinner
   - Modal closes
   - User can see deletion happening

6. **Deletion complete**
   - Tournament disappears from list
   - No page reload needed
   - Success is silent (no notification)

7. **If error occurs**
   - Error message appears at top of page
   - Tournament remains in list
   - User can retry

---

## What Gets Deleted

### Deleted from Database:
1. **Tournament record** (`tournaments` table)
2. **Player participation** (`tournament_players` table)
3. **Tournament rounds** (`tournament_rounds` table)
4. **Game links** (`tournament_games` table)

### NOT Deleted:
1. **Player profiles** (`players` table) - preserved for other tournaments
2. **Game analyses** (`chess_analyses` table) - preserved for reuse
3. **Videos** (`videos` table) - if any games have videos

**Rationale**:
- Player data is reusable across tournaments
- Game analyses are expensive to compute and may be used elsewhere
- Only the tournament organization is deleted, not the underlying data

---

## Database CASCADE Behavior

The migrations set up CASCADE delete constraints:

```sql
-- From 008_create_tournament_players.sql
tournament_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES tournaments(id) ON DELETE CASCADE

-- From 009_create_tournament_rounds.sql
tournament_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES tournaments(id) ON DELETE CASCADE

-- From 010_create_tournament_games.sql
tournament_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES tournaments(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
round_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES tournament_rounds(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
```

**How it works**:
1. User deletes tournament X
2. Database deletes `tournaments` record for X
3. CASCADE triggers automatically delete:
   - All `tournament_players` where `tournament_id = X`
   - All `tournament_rounds` where `tournament_id = X`
   - All `tournament_games` where `tournament_id = X`
4. No orphaned data remains

---

## UI/UX Features

### Visual Design

**Delete Button**:
- Red color (destructive action)
- Trash icon (universal delete symbol)
- Hover effect (background color change)
- Disabled state (grayed out during deletion)
- Loading spinner (shows progress)

**Confirmation Modal**:
- Full-screen overlay (focuses attention)
- Semi-transparent black background (dims page)
- White/dark themed card (respects theme)
- Red heading (emphasizes danger)
- Clear warning text (explains consequences)
- Two-button layout (Cancel left, Delete right)

### Interaction Design

**Click Handling**:
- Delete button stops event propagation
- Prevents navigation to tournament detail
- Opens modal immediately

**Modal Behavior**:
- No close-on-outside-click (requires explicit choice)
- ESC key doesn't close (prevents accidental dismissal)
- Must click Cancel or Delete

**Feedback**:
- Spinner on delete button (shows action in progress)
- Instant removal from list (optimistic update)
- Error message at top if fails (clear error state)

---

## Error Handling

### API Errors

**Tournament Not Found (404)**:
```json
{
  "error": "Tournament not found"
}
```
User sees: "Failed to delete tournament: Tournament not found"

**Database Error (500)**:
```json
{
  "error": "Failed to delete tournament",
  "details": "Connection timeout"
}
```
User sees: "Failed to delete tournament: Connection timeout"

### UI Error Display

```typescript
{error && (
  <div className="bg-red-50 dark:bg-red-900/20 border...">
    <p className="text-red-800 dark:text-red-200">{error}</p>
  </div>
)}
```

- Appears at top of page
- Red background (error indication)
- Clear error message
- Persists until next action
- Can retry deletion after error

---

## Testing

### Manual Testing Steps

1. **Import a test tournament**
   ```
   - Go to /tournaments/import
   - Import sample_tournament.pgn
   - Note the tournament name
   ```

2. **View in list**
   ```
   - Go to /tournaments
   - Find the imported tournament
   - See delete button in top-right
   ```

3. **Click delete**
   ```
   - Click red trash icon
   - Modal appears
   - Read warning message
   ```

4. **Cancel deletion**
   ```
   - Click "Cancel"
   - Modal closes
   - Tournament still in list
   ```

5. **Delete tournament**
   ```
   - Click delete again
   - Click "Delete" in modal
   - See spinner on button
   - Tournament disappears from list
   ```

6. **Verify in database**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM tournaments WHERE name = 'Sample Round Robin 2024';
   -- Should return 0 rows

   SELECT * FROM tournament_players WHERE tournament_id = '<deleted_id>';
   -- Should return 0 rows

   SELECT * FROM tournament_games WHERE tournament_id = '<deleted_id>';
   -- Should return 0 rows
   ```

7. **Verify games preserved**
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM chess_analyses;
   -- Should still have the same number of analyses
   ```

### Edge Cases

**Delete while viewing detail**:
- User on `/tournaments/[id]`
- Tournament is deleted by another user/tab
- Detail page shows 404 error

**Delete multiple tournaments quickly**:
- Click delete on Tournament A
- While deleting, click delete on Tournament B
- Both should delete successfully

**Network error during delete**:
- Delete fails with error message
- Tournament remains in list
- Can retry deletion

**Refresh during deletion**:
- Page refreshes mid-delete
- Tournament may or may not be deleted
- List reloads and shows current state

---

## Performance

### Database

**Single Query**:
```sql
DELETE FROM tournaments WHERE id = $1
```

**CASCADE happens automatically**:
- No additional queries needed
- Database handles related deletions
- Transactional (all or nothing)

**Time Complexity**: O(1) for tournament deletion, O(n) for CASCADE where n = number of related records

### UI

**Optimistic Update**:
- Tournament removed from list immediately
- No wait for server response
- Better perceived performance

**Network Request**:
- Single DELETE request
- ~50-100ms typical response time
- Async (doesn't block UI)

---

## Security Considerations

### Authorization

**Current Implementation**:
- No authorization check
- Any user can delete any tournament

**Future Enhancement**:
```typescript
// Check if user owns tournament or is admin
const canDelete = tournament.created_by === userId || isAdmin(userId);
if (!canDelete) {
  return NextResponse.json(
    { error: 'Unauthorized' },
    { status: 403 }
  );
}
```

### Audit Trail

**Future Enhancement**:
- Log deletions to audit table
- Track who deleted what and when
- Allow rollback/restore

```sql
CREATE TABLE tournament_audit (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  tournament_id UUID,
  tournament_name VARCHAR(255),
  deleted_by VARCHAR(255),
  deleted_at TIMESTAMP,
  tournament_data JSONB
);
```

---

## Future Enhancements

### Soft Delete

Instead of permanent deletion:
```sql
ALTER TABLE tournaments ADD COLUMN deleted_at TIMESTAMP;

-- Soft delete
UPDATE tournaments SET deleted_at = NOW() WHERE id = $1;

-- Filter deleted tournaments
SELECT * FROM tournaments WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;
```

### Restore Functionality

```typescript
// Restore deleted tournament
async function restoreTournament(tournamentId: string) {
  await pool.query(
    `UPDATE tournaments SET deleted_at = NULL WHERE id = $1`,
    [tournamentId]
  );
}
```

### Bulk Delete

Select multiple tournaments and delete at once:
```typescript
async function deleteTournaments(tournamentIds: string[]) {
  await pool.query(
    `DELETE FROM tournaments WHERE id = ANY($1)`,
    [tournamentIds]
  );
}
```

### Confirmation Input

Require typing tournament name to confirm:
```typescript
<input
  value={confirmText}
  onChange={(e) => setConfirmText(e.target.value)}
  placeholder={`Type "${tournament.name}" to confirm`}
/>
<button
  disabled={confirmText !== tournament.name}
  onClick={handleDelete}
>
  Delete
</button>
```
